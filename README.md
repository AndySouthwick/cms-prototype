# Prisma CMS Site Builder
This project is built to work with a prisma graphql server.
With it you can create keys and values that corespond to components on pages
built to be used with https://github.com/AndySouthwick/prisma-cms

the idea is you build out your local component library and then add them to the component-display component. Your components are usually dumb components
that consume data. inside of the cms at /type-creator you can add your model that represents
your components data. This adds the model to the page creator on /dashboard.  

We took the idea of creating content types from drupal. So your content types are what house the data or the content.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.
